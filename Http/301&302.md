# 301 And 302

1. __301__
    * A 301 redirect sends the message to search engines that a website or page has been moved permanently.
    * Many people use this type of redirect when they purchase domains that they want being sent to their primary domain.
    * When you use a 301, Google removes the old page from their index and link equity from that page is transferred to the new one.
2. __302__
    * A 302 redirect lets search engines know that a website or page has been moved temporarily.
    * You would use this type of redirect if you want to send users to a new site or page for a short period of time, such as when youâ€™re redesigning or updating your website.
    * When you choose this type of redirect, the original page remains indexed in Google and link equity is transferred to the new URL because Google knows this is just temporary.
